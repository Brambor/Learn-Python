# Task

Make a dice throwing game, player first throws dice, decides which dice to reroll and then rerolls them.

Can be played until command such as 'end' is written.

Reroll perhaps using command 'reroll'. Then they could be asked which dice to keep (figure out how).

If any opponent is implemented, once the dices are rolled and rerolled, decide who won, or if it was a draw.

AI opponent could be implemented, easy implementation playes randomly.

You can also make it two player game. Make sure players know which one is currently entering commands. One player probably will be at disadvantage since they are rerolling first, ignore it.

Make sure that the player knows what he selected and how to select what he can do. They shouldn't need to read the code, just doble click on the program and play throught it.

The game should be reasonably simple. The focus is to comunicate with player that cannot read code.
