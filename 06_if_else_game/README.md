# Task

Make a text game, that prints series of situations and lets the player decide from a text menu (by writing and pressing enter) what the player does. Make sure that the player knows what he selected and how to select what he can do. They shouldn't need to read the code, just doble click on the program and play throught it.

The game should be reasonably simple. The focus is to comunicate with player that cannot read code.
