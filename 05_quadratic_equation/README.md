# Task

Make a function that takes a, b, c as an arguments and somehow prints or returns the result.

`ax^2 + bx + c = 0`

### Features:
1. Handle regular cases, when there are two solutions.
2. Handle cases, when there is one solution, or none.
3. Think and program a way so that it is intuitive to use the function. Document the function.
4. Make optional parameters work. The default value should be zero. Example: `quadratic(a=5, c=1)` -> x_1=0, x_2 doesn't exist.
5. By another parameter control, whether the function should return the result or print it. (Or both if you want).
6. Make it work for complex numbers, where every quadratic equation has two roots. See module `complex`. `complex(1, 5)` -> `(1+5j)`.
